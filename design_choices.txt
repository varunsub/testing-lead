1. Next.js:
    Flexible framework with the power of SSR and an SPA. 
    It intergrates really well with my favorite state management library TanStack (formerly react-query).
    Allows ultimate flexibility on the front end and easy deployment with Vercel.

2. Postgres:
    A part of Alma's stack.
    Powerful relational database with large community and good support.

3. GCloud:
    Simple cloud hosting for buckets and uploads.
    Less boilerplate than S3 in my experience.

4. Sendgrid:
    Supported by Twilio with a good amount of third party documentation.

5. Heroku:
    I regret it. It was a horrible choice.

6. Vercel:
    Great integration with Next.js.
    Clean UI and seemeless github integration and deployment.

7. Design choices front end:
    Since nothing is meant to be SSO friendly, implementing SSR was not a priority.
